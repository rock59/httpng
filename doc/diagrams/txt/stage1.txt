title HTTPNG threads interaction concept (several writes, proposed design, stage1)

participant HTTP(S) worker thread


participant [


participant Per-request fiber


participant TX (one of httpng fibers)

[->HTTP(S) worker thread:HTTP(S) request from client
box over HTTP(S) worker thread#yellow:Allocate `shuttle`
box over HTTP(S) worker thread:Parse HTTP(S) request, pack it into `shuttle`
HTTP(S) worker thread->TX (one of httpng fibers):`shuttle` with parsed HTTP(S) request
note over HTTP(S) worker thread:Sleep or handle something else
box over TX (one of httpng fibers):Create new fiber
